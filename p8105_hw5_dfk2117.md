``` r
library(tidyverse)
library(rvest)
```

``` r
file_name =
  list.files("data", full.names = TRUE)

df_1 =
  list.files("data", full.names = TRUE) |> 
  map_dfr(read_csv) |> 
  bind_cols(id = file_name) |>
  mutate(group = 
           case_when(
             str_detect(file_name, "con") ~ "control",
             str_detect(file_name, "exp") ~ "experimental"
             )
         ) |> 
  mutate(id_num = 
           as.integer(
             str_extract(
               id, "\\d+")
             )
         ) |> 
  relocate(id_num, group, .before = week_1) |> 
  select(!id) |> 
  pivot_longer(cols = c(week_1, week_2, week_3, week_4, week_5, week_6, week_7, week_8),
               names_to = "time",
               values_to = "value") |> 
  mutate(time = 
          as.integer(
            str_extract(
              time, "\\d+")))
```

Tidy the result; manipulate file names to include control arm and
subject ID, make sure weekly observations are “tidy”, and do any other
tidying that’s necessary

``` r
df_1_plots =
  df_1 |> 
  mutate(subject_id = paste(group, id_num, sep = "_"))



df_1_plots |> 
  ggplot(aes(x = time, y = value, group = subject_id, color = group)) + 
  geom_line() + 
  labs(
    title = "Data Value for Participants Over Time by Group",
    x = "Time (weeks)",
    y = "Data Value"
  )
```
